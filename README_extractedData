## Contents
Summary trial- and subject-level data files. 

Note that 100 participants were included in a larger study, while 50 completed the color wheel/choice task analyzed in this study. Participant numbers 1:25 and 51:75 were used in this study, while other numbers completed different experimental tasks.
